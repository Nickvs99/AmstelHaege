### The case
Amstelhaege is a new residetial area that needs a lay-out. The objective is to get a so high as possible worth for the whole area. The size of the Area is 160 x 180 meters. The area has places with water. The water in the area has three configurations. There are three types of houses. Each with a different size, worth and mandatory free space. For every extra meter free space a percentage of the worth of the house is added to the worth of the house. The free space stops if it hits another house. The free space is not effected by the border of the area or water.
